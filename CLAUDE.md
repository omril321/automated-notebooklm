# Automated NotebookLM - Claude Code Context

This project automates Google NotebookLM to generate podcast audio from URLs, converts audio to MP3, and optionally uploads episodes to RedCircle. It includes Monday.com integration for candidate selection and metadata processing.

## Project Overview

**Automated NotebookLM** is a TypeScript automation pipeline that:

- Generates NotebookLM studio podcasts from URLs using Playwright automation
- Converts WAV audio to high-quality MP3 using FFmpeg
- Uploads MP3 episodes to RedCircle (optional)
- Integrates with Monday.com boards for candidate management with intelligent scoring
- Supports both new podcast generation and resuming from existing NotebookLM URLs

## System Dependencies

- **Node.js >= 24.4** with Yarn package manager
- **FFmpeg** with libmp3lame codec for high-quality MP3 conversion
- **Chrome browser** for Playwright automation (automatically detected)
- **Google account** preferably without 2FA for reliable automation
- **RedCircle account** with existing podcast (required only for upload feature)

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript with functional programming patterns
- **Package Manager**: Yarn
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright (Chrome channel)
- **Audio Processing**: fluent-ffmpeg with quality optimization
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 with UI dashboard and coverage
- **Web Scraping**: Cheerio for metadata extraction
- **Configuration**: dotenv for environment management
- **Monday.com Integration**: Official @mondaydotcomorg/api SDK

## Monday.com Integration Details

### Board Structure

The system expects these Monday.com board columns:

- `Podcast link` (Text) - Generated podcast URLs
- `Type` (Status) - Content type classification
- `ðŸ”—` (Link) - Source URLs for processing
- `Podcast fitness` (Formula) - Numerical fitness score for ranking
- `Metadata` (LongText) - Extracted article metadata JSON
- `Non-podcastable` (Checkbox) - Manual exclusion flag
- `NotebookLM with generated audio` (Link) - Existing NotebookLM URLs for reuse

### Candidate Selection Process

1. **Filtering**: Items with `podcastFitness > 0` and no existing podcast link
2. **Prioritization**: Sorts by fitness score (descending) for optimal candidates
3. **Audio-Ready Processing**: Prioritizes items with existing NotebookLM audio links
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respects NotebookLM daily limits (typically 3 new generations)
5. **Batch Updates**: Updates board with generated podcast URLs

### Metadata Extraction

- **2-Phase Processing**: First extracts metadata, then processes for podcasting
- **Content Analysis**: Calculates code percentage, text length, video detection
- **Batch Processing**: Handles 10 URLs at a time with rate limiting
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically flags non-podcastable content

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite using Vitest:

- **Real Integration Testing**: Tests actual FFmpeg, not mocked behavior
- **Service Testing**: All core services have dedicated test suites
- **Configuration Testing**: Monday.com setup validation
- **Content Analysis Testing**: Metadata extraction and scoring

Key test files:

- `src/services/*.test.ts` - Service-specific tests
- `src/monday/*.test.ts` - Monday.com integration tests
- `src/utils.test.ts` - Core utility functions

## Code Patterns & Architecture

### Functional Programming

- Pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Single Responsibility Principle throughout
- Comprehensive error handling with context

### Type Safety

- Zero `any` types - full TypeScript compliance
- Official Monday.com API types integration
- Template literal types for URL validation
- Proper error type definitions with custom error classes

### Error Handling

- Fail-fast approach with early validation
- Context-rich error messages for debugging
- Debug screenshots for browser automation failures
- Comprehensive logging with structured data

## Production Features

### Audio Quality Standards

- **320kbps bitrate** for optimal podcast quality
- **44.1kHz sample rate** (CD quality)
- **Best quality encoding** settings for smallest file size
- **Consistent metadata** embedding for podcast platforms

### Reliability & Performance

- **Rate limiting protection** (15-second delays for API calls)
- **Batch processing** (10 URLs at a time for metadata)
- **Audio-ready optimization** (prioritizes existing NotebookLM content)
- **Generous timeouts** for NotebookLM generation (10-12 minutes)
- **Anti-detection measures** for browser automation stability

### Monitoring & Debugging

- **Structured logging** throughout the pipeline
- **Debug screenshots** on automation failures
- **Progress tracking** for batch operations
- **Error reporting** with full context and stack traces
- **Performance metrics** for optimization

## Current Limitations

- **UI Dependency**: Relies on current Google NotebookLM and RedCircle interfaces
- **Daily Limits**: NotebookLM restricts podcast generations (typically 3 per day)
- **Authentication**: Works best with non-2FA Google accounts
- **Browser Requirements**: Requires stable Chrome installation
- **Network Sensitivity**: Captchas or rate limits may interrupt automation

## Main Operations

### Monday.com Batch Processing (Default)

```bash
# Processes candidates from Monday board with intelligent prioritization
yarn generate-podcasts
```

This command:

1. Fetches candidates from Monday.com board
2. Prioritizes audio-ready items first
3. Processes remaining candidates up to daily limit
4. Updates board with generated podcast URLs
5. Provides comprehensive progress reporting

### Architecture Flow

1. **Board Analysis**: Fetches and filters Monday.com board items
2. **Candidate Prioritization**: Ranks by fitness score and audio-ready status
3. **Metadata Processing**: Extracts and analyzes content for each URL
4. **Podcast Generation**: Automates NotebookLM for audio creation
5. **Audio Processing**: Converts WAV to high-quality MP3
6. **Publishing**: Uploads to RedCircle and updates Monday.com board

## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg Issues

- Ensure FFmpeg includes libmp3lame codec: `ffmpeg -codecs | grep mp3`
- Check system PATH includes FFmpeg binary
- Verify temp directory permissions for audio processing

### Browser Automation

- Update Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install chrome`
- Check for captchas or account restrictions
- Verify Chrome browser installation and version compatibility

### Monday.com Integration

- Validate API token has board read/write permissions
- Ensure board URL format matches expected pattern
- Confirm all required columns exist with correct types
- Check excluded group IDs configuration

This project demonstrates a production-ready automation pipeline with comprehensive error handling, intelligent prioritization, and robust monitoring capabilities for automated podcast generation at scale.
