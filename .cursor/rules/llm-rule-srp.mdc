description: LLM tool definitions must follow Single Responsibility Principle with service delegation
globs: **/*.ts*

Summary:
LLM tool definitions must act as thin wrappers that delegate functionality to well-defined, single-responsibility services.

Guidelines:

- Keep tool definitions minimal â€” focus on input schema, metadata, and delegation.
- All core logic must live in a dedicated service class with clear inputs and outputs.
- Services should be testable, reusable, and adhere to Single Responsibility Principle.
- Tool execute functions should be short, readable, and primarily call a service.

Avoid:

- Embedding complex logic directly in the tool definition
- Mixing concerns (e.g., schema + business logic + side effects) in one layer
