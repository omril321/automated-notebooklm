# Memory Bank Standards: Date Accuracy & Content Conciseness

## 🎯 Purpose

This roll ensures memory bank files maintain accurate dates and concise content when working with the CursorRIPER♦Σ memory system.

## 📅 Date Accuracy Standards

### Required Actions

1. **Always check current date** before updating any memory bank file:

   ```bash
   date
   ```

2. **Use exact current date** in "Updated" field:

   ```markdown
   _v1.X | Created: YYYY-MM-DD | Updated: 2025-07-08_
   ```

3. **Never assume or remember dates** from previous sessions

### Validation

- ✅ Date format: DD-MM-YYYY
- ✅ Date is current (not from previous sessions)
- ✅ All memory bank files use same date for batch updates

## 📝 Content Conciseness Standards

### Memory Bank Content Rules

- **High-level overview only** - No implementation details
- **Patterns and decisions** - Not code examples
- **Essential information** - Not verbose explanations
- **Reference to code** - Not duplicate code content

### Content Validation Checklist

Before updating memory bank files, verify:

- ❓ Is this information essential for project context?
- ❓ Does this belong in code/docs instead?
- ❓ Can this be expressed more concisely?
- ❓ Is this a decision/pattern or implementation detail?

### Specific Guidelines by File Type

#### Tech Context (σ₃)

- ✅ Architecture patterns and decisions
- ✅ Technology stack overview
- ✅ Key design patterns (without implementation)
- ❌ Detailed code examples
- ❌ Configuration file contents
- ❌ Verbose API documentation

#### Progress Tracker (σ₅)

- ✅ Status and milestones
- ✅ Completed tasks summary
- ✅ Next steps overview
- ❌ Detailed implementation steps
- ❌ Code snippets
- ❌ Verbose technical explanations

#### Active Context (σ₄)

- ✅ Current focus and decisions
- ✅ Immediate tasks and priorities
- ✅ Context references

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Issues for techContext.md and progress.md

- ❌ Copying code blocks into memory bank
- ❌ Including verbose implementation details
- ❌ Duplicating content from code files
- ❌ Adding configuration examples
- ❌ Including detailed API documentation

## ✅ Success Criteria

Memory bank updates are successful when:

- ✅ Date is current and accurate
- ✅ Content is concise and essential
- ✅ Information belongs in the correct memory bank files
- ✅ No unnecessary implementation details included
- ✅ References to code/docs instead of duplicating content
