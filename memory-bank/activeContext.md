## 🔮 Current Focus

🎯 **PRODUCTION EXCELLENCE**: User Enhanced Monday Integration with Smart Filtering & Advanced Type Safety

### ✅ Implementation & Production Enhancements Complete:

**Successfully Delivered:**

- ✅ **Monday Board Integration**: Complete 3-step process (candidates → generate → update)
- ✅ **New Architecture**: Logic moved to `generateUsingMondayBoard()` in `generateAndUpload.ts`
- ✅ **Simplified CLI**: Clean `--monday-mode` flag implementation
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper typing with required `podcastUrl` field

**User's Latest Production Enhancements (2025-08-06):**

1. ✅ **Numerical Fitness Scoring**: Replaced boolean `fittingForPodcast` with numerical `podcastFitness` for intelligent ranking
2. ✅ **Smart Candidate Selection**: Filter by `podcastFitness > 0` and sort descending by fitness score (best candidates first)
3. ✅ **Enhanced Type System**: `SourceBoardItem` interface with numerical fitness + template literal URLs (`\`${"http"}${string}\``)
4. ✅ **Formula Column Optimization**: Monday formula columns with numerical calculations for ranking
5. ✅ **Simplified Update Logic**: Streamlined podcast URL updates with direct text field assignment
6. ✅ **Performance Enhancement**: Hard-coded column IDs with Text type for optimal Monday integration

**Results**: Production-ready system with intelligent filtering, bulletproof type safety, and scalability
