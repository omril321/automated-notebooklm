_Π: DEVELOPMENT | Ω: EXECUTE_

## 🔮 Current Focus

✅ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**: Monday.com integration foundation 100% complete - ready for next development phase

### 📋 Monday.com Integration Foundation: 100% COMPLETE ✅

**3-Step Implementation Foundation Delivered:**

1. ✅ **📊 Board Access & Validation** - Complete authentication, board structure validation, and configuration
2. ✅ **🔍 Type Safety & Error Handling** - Official Monday.com API types integration with comprehensive error handling
3. ✅ **📝 Configuration Management** - Environment-based configuration with consolidated column definitions

**Recent Completion (Current Session):**

- ✅ **Column Configuration Consolidation**: Refactored `REQUIRED_COLUMNS` to include both title AND type in single location
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminated scattered column configuration across multiple files
- ✅ **Test Updates**: All 10 tests passing with new consolidated structure
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean compilation with zero errors
- ✅ **Architecture Cleanup**: Following Single Responsibility Principle properly

**Foundation Architecture Achievements:**

- ✅ Board configuration: URL-based access with API token from env var
- ✅ Authentication: Personal API token approach (MONDAY_API_TOKEN)
- ✅ Column structure: Consolidated configuration - "Podcast link" (URL), "Type" (Status), "🔗" (URL source)
- ✅ SDK integration: @mondaydotcomorg/api with proper GraphQL typing
- ✅ Error handling: Clean 3-error system (INVALID_CONFIG, BOARD_ACCESS_ERROR, API_ERROR)
- ✅ Functional architecture: Pure functions following TypeScript guidelines

**Foundation Services Delivered:**

- ✅ Configuration service with environment validation and URL parsing
- ✅ API client service with singleton pattern
- ✅ Board validator service with comprehensive column validation
- ✅ Error handling system with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Type definitions using official Monday.com API types

## 🎯 Phase Completion Status

### ✅ Monday.com Integration Foundation: 100% COMPLETE

**What Was Delivered:**

- Complete functional foundation for Monday.com board integration
- Production-ready configuration and validation services
- TypeScript-safe error handling and API client
- Comprehensive test coverage for configuration service
